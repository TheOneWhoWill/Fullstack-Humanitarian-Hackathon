## Inspiration

A lot of people have a lot of kindness to give. However, not everyone knows how they want to help the world.
Do they want to push for women's rights, to end world hunger, or stop a war, the possibilities are endless. 
And even after that finding, a nonprofit-based foundation that does cause justice is another issue itself.

## What it does

Waffles :D indexes, stores, and most importantly helps you find the best charities through an easy to use search engine.

## How we built it

For the server-side we used mongo atlas for database hosting, we then worked on creating a restful backend using Express 
which we managed to link to our database using Mongoose. Then for the client-side, we used React for the main UI, Node-Sass 
for styling and sent requests to our API using Axios.

## Challenges we ran into

To get the user's search query in the URL, we tried using Params and a simple form. However, by default Forms didn't route the 
way we needed it to. So instead we used the preventDefault function and redirected the user by ourselves.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

The final UI had some kinks and mixed reviews but with the time we had, I believe we made a great minimalist style UI that is both 
intuitive and easy to use.

## What's next for Waffles :D

Looking at Github their arent many open-source search engines and we decided since we already built why shouldn't we benefit the 
common good and give it out to the world.
